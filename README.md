You are tasked with constructing a fully-function FRC-style robot that can accomplish the tasks listed below within the provided design parameters. Team 8421 will build a suspicious package removal robot, aka SusBot, through teamwork, creativity, and problem-solving. SusBot must be able to do the following consistently:

  Lift and carry a minimum of six inches off the floor a 12x12x12 inch box or small backpack weighing approximately five pounds. 
  Push or pull open an unlocked school door. 
  Allow the driver to navigate the robot remotely in dark places.
  Traverse conditions and obstacles commonly found in school hallways or classrooms.
  
Design Parameters
  A frame perimeter without bumpers less than or equal to 140 inches.
  A maximum height of 48 inches or less.
  A maximum weight, without the battery or bumpers of 125 lbs.
  All parts of the robot must be inside the frame perimeter at start-up. 
  A maximum reach of 24 inches outside the frame perimeter.  

Rules
  All of SusBotâ€™s parts, systems, and code must be designed and built by student team members.
  Mentors may provide support and hints for using tools, structuring code, designing systems, and sourcing materials.
  Team members may use all available materials in the robotics lab excluding those designated or part of our current robot.
